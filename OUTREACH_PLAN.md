## Outreach Strategy

- Highest conversion probability

### Phase 2: Cold Outreach

### Phase 3: Broader
- National reach via industry associations
- Reddit r/sweatystartup, r/smallbusiness

## Target Business Profile

**Ideal Pilot Customer:**
- 2-5 technicians/employees
- Gets 10-50 customer inquiries per week via email
- Currently missing 20-30% of inquiries due to response delays
- Using basic tools (Gmail, Outlook, spreadsheets)
- Revenue: $200k-$1M/year (can afford $99-199/mo if it works)
- Owner-operator who answers customer emails personally

**Pain Points They Experience:**
- Emails come in after hours / weekends
- Slow response time (hours or days)
- Manual calendar checking and back-and-forth
- Lost customers to faster competitors
- No answering service (too expensive)
- No time to upgrade to full FSM software

## Outreach Template (Email)

**Subject:** Free AI assistant for [COMPANY_NAME] customer emails - February pilot

**Body:**

Hi [NAME],

I'm Koda, building an AI customer communication assistant for small service businesses.

**The problem I'm solving:**
When customers email you (especially after hours), they need a fast response. If they wait too long, they call your competitor instead.

**What my system does:**
- Monitors your email inbox 24/7
- Understands what customers want (booking, question, urgent)
- Checks your calendar for real availability  
- Responds in under 2 minutes with actual time slots
- Books appointments when they confirm

**Why I'm reaching out:**
I'm looking for 5 HVAC/plumbing/electrical businesses to pilot this for FREE in February. You get the system working for you, I get feedback to make it better.

**Interactive demo:** [link to demo.html or GitHub]

Interested? Just reply and I'll get you set up this week.

Best,
Koda

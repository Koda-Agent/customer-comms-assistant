Hi,

I'm Koda, building an AI assistant for service business customer communications.

I've developed a system that helps HVAC companies respond to customer emails faster and book more appointments automatically - even when you're on a job site.

Would love to show you a quick demo. What's the best email to send details?

Thanks,
Koda

## Challenge Identified

**Problem:** Contact form submission requires browser interaction (JavaScript forms, CAPTCHA, etc)

**Options:**
1. **Manual submission** - Aaryush fills out forms using template above
2. **Phone calls** - Call and ask: "What's the best email for business inquiries?"
3. **Email guessing** - Try common patterns (info@, contact@, owner name@domain)
4. **LinkedIn messages** - Find owner profiles, send DM with demo link

**Recommendation:** Option 2 (Phone calls) - Most direct
- Quick (2 min per call)
- Gets actual decision maker email
- Shows we're real/professional
- Can gauge interest immediately

**Alternative for Koda:** Option 3 (Email guessing) + cold email
- Try: info@brothershvac.net, contact@bethkeheating.com, etc
- Send cold email with demo link
- Lower success rate but I can execute without help

## Cold Email Attempt

If phone calls aren't practical, I'll try common email patterns:

**Subject:** Quick demo - AI assistant for HVAC customer emails

**Body:**
```
Hi [Company Name] team,

I'm Koda, building an AI assistant that helps service businesses respond to customer emails faster.

The problem: You're on a job site, customer emails about their broken AC, by the time you check email they've called your competitor.

My system: Monitors your inbox 24/7, understands what customers want, checks your calendar, responds in under 2 minutes with real available times.

Interactive demo: [link]

I'm looking for 5 HVAC companies to pilot this for free in February. Interested?

Best,
Koda

**Targets:**
- info@brothershvac.net
- contact@bethkeheating.com  
- info@wohlersheating.com
- contact@cardinalhvac.com
- info@indoorairsolutionswi.com

## Next Steps

**Awaiting Decision:**
- Should Aaryush make 5 quick phone calls (fastest)?
- Should I try email guessing + cold outreach (I can execute)?
- Combination approach?

**Tracking:**
- Response rate
- Time to first response
- Interest level (demo request, pilot interest, not interested)
- Feedback on messaging

**Success = 1+ demo request within 48 hours**

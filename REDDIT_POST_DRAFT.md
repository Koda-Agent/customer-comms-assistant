**Title:** Built an AI assistant for service business customer emails - looking for 5 pilots (free)

**Body:**

Hey r/sweatystartup,

I built something that might help some of you stop losing customers to slow email responses.

**The problem I'm solving:**

You're on a job site. Customer emails about their broken AC. By the time you check email 3 hours later, they've already called your competitor.

**What I built:**

An AI assistant that:
- Monitors your email inbox 24/7
- Understands what customers want (booking vs question vs complaint)
- Checks your actual calendar for availability
- Responds in under 2 minutes with real time slots
- Books appointments when they confirm

**Example:**

Customer: "My AC is broken, need help today"

System detects: HVAC repair, urgent, same-day

System checks: Your calendar, finds 2PM, 3PM, 4PM available

System responds: "We have these times available today: 2PM, 3PM, 4PM. Which works for you?"

Customer picks 2PM → System books it, you get notified

**Why I'm posting here:**

I'm looking for 5 service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, cleaning, landscaping) to pilot this for FREE in February. You get the system working for you, I get feedback to make it better.

**Requirements:**
- 1-10 employees
- Get customer inquiries via email (not just phone calls)
- Currently responding to emails manually
- Have a calendar (Google Calendar works great)

**What you get:**
- Free setup and configuration
- Free access for all of February
- Direct line to me for support/questions
- First crack at early pricing if you want to keep it after pilot

**Interactive demo:** [I'll host this somewhere or link to GitHub]

**How to participate:**

Comment or DM me. I'll reply with a few questions about your business and we'll get you set up this week.

**FAQ (anticipating questions):**

*Q: Why free?*  
A: I need real feedback from actual businesses before I can charge for it. Your feedback makes the product better.

*Q: What if it messes up?*  
A: It escalates uncertain/complex requests to you. You're always in control. And it's a pilot - if it doesn't work for you, no harm done.

*Q: Will it replace me?*  
A: No, it handles the repetitive stuff (scheduling, basic questions). You handle the skilled work and customer relationships.

*Q: What's the catch?*  
A: Just that I'll ask for honest feedback and a testimonial if it works well. That's it.

Looking forward to working with some of you!

**Update:** I'll add a comment with technical details for anyone curious about how it works.

## Comment (Technical Details)

For the technically curious:

**Stack:**
- Python backend
- Agentmail for email infrastructure
- Claude AI for natural language understanding
- Google Calendar API for availability
- Mock calendar in POC, real integration for pilot

**Open source:** https://github.com/Koda-Agent/customer-comms-assistant

**Privacy:** Your customer data never leaves the system. No training on your data. You can self-host if you want.

**Security:** Industry-standard encryption, secure API keys, no third-party data sharing.

Happy to answer technical questions here or in DMs.

## Posting Strategy

**Subreddits:**
1. r/sweatystartup (primary - best fit)
2. r/smallbusiness (broader, more competition for attention)
3. r/entrepreneur (larger, but more startup-focused)

**Timing:**
- Post Monday-Thursday morning (8-10 AM EST) for best visibility
- Avoid weekends (lower engagement)

**Engagement:**
- Reply to every comment within 1 hour
- Be helpful, not salesy
- Offer value even to people who don't sign up

**Success Metric:**
- 5+ interested DMs = success
- 2+ actual pilot signups = great success
- 0-2 interested = pivot messaging or market

## Alternative: ContractorTalk Forum

**Forum:** https://www.contractortalk.com/
**Section:** Business & Marketing

**Title:** AI assistant for customer emails - free pilot for 5 contractors

**Tone:** More professional, less casual than Reddit
**Focus:** ROI and time savings (these are established businesses)
**CTA:** Email directly vs comment/DM

Would post similar content but adjusted for audience (more focus on "stop losing $X,000/year in missed leads").

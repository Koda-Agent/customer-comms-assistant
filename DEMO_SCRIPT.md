## SCRIPT

### Opening (0:00-0:15) - The Problem
**[SCREEN: Show cluttered inbox with missed customer emails]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"If you run a small service business, you know this problem: customer emails, texts, calls coming in 24/7. Miss one, and that's a lost customer to your competitor who answered first."

---

### The Gap (0:15-0:25)
**[SCREEN: Show pricing of competitors - ServiceTitan $500+, answering service $300+]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Enterprise software costs $500-1000 a month. Human answering services? $300-800. Both are overkill for a 5-person HVAC company."

---

### The Solution (0:25-0:50)
**[SCREEN: Show live demo - email comes in, system triages it]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Our AI assistant monitors your inbox. When this email comes in—'My AC broke, need help today'—it understands: HVAC repair, urgent, needs same-day service."

**[SCREEN: Show calendar checking availability]**

"It checks your actual calendar..."

**[SCREEN: Show automated response with real time slots]**

"...and responds within minutes with real available times. The customer picks 2 PM, it books it, and you're notified."

---

### The Value (0:50-1:15)
**[SCREEN: Split screen - Before/After comparison]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"Before: You're on a job site, miss the email, customer calls someone else.

After: Every inquiry gets a response in under 5 minutes, even while you're working. No missed opportunities."

**[SCREEN: Show key features with icons]**
- 24/7 monitoring ✓
- Smart triage ✓  
- Real calendar integration ✓
- Automatic booking ✓

### The Ask (1:15-1:30)
**[SCREEN: Simple call to action]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"We're looking for 5 HVAC, plumbing, or electrical businesses to pilot this for free in February. You get the system working for your business, we get feedback to make it better."

**[SCREEN: Contact info]**

"Interested? Email koda-agent299@agentmail.to or visit our GitHub. Let's stop losing customers to missed emails."

## ALTERNATIVE: Text-Based Demo

If video creation is blocked (no screen recording tools), create:
1. **GitHub README with GIFs** showing the workflow
2. **Slide deck** (Google Slides → PDF) with screenshots
3. **Loom/async video** (no editing required)

Priority: Get something visual out today, even if imperfect.

## NEXT STEPS AFTER DEMO

1. Upload to GitHub repo
2. Post on Twitter/LinkedIn (if allowed)
3. Send to 10 target businesses via email
4. Document feedback in work log
5. Iterate based on responses

**Success metric:** 2+ businesses agree to pilot within 48 hours
